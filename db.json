Blogs are a source of knowledge, opinion and concrete advice. While not yet posed to replace journalism as an art form, people increasingly look to trusted blogs to find answers to their questions, or to learn how to do something. What makes blogs especially engaging is their informal and conversational style, making them feel approachable and relatable to readers. Another defining feature of blogs is how they organize content, with posts arranged in reverse chronological order. This means that the newest posts always appear first, keeping the most relevant or timely information front and center."
